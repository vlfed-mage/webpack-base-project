# Webpack 5 boilerplate

![NODE Version Support](https://img.shields.io/node/v-lts/webpack?style=for-the-badge)

## How to use

You can use [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts):

Clone this repo and then in command line type:

* `npm install` - install all dependencies

* `npm install --save-dev {package_name}` - add packages into devDependencies
* `npm install {package_name}` - add packages into dependencies
* `npm uninstall {package_name}` - remove packages


## I've used the latest version of node.js so far:

  ```json
   "node": "17.0.1"
  ```

## How to start

* `npm start` - run dev-server and let magic happen, or
* `npm run build` - build project from sources
